## ACK Examples

This repository contains example scripts and resource definitions that can be
directly applied to your cluster, making it faster to get started with an ACK
controller. 

The structure of this repository is as follows:
|Directory|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`resources`|YAML files for individual ACK resources, split by service controller|
|`scripts`|Scripts for easily bootstrapping and installing an ACK controller|

These examples are maintained by the community and may become out of date if the
custom resource definitions change.
